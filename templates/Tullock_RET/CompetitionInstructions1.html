    <p>
        You have been randomly allocated into a group of {{ Constants.players_per_group|apnumber }} participants: A, B and C<br>
        You are participant <strong>{{ player.role }}</strong>. <br>
        The experiment is anonymous. You will not be told who the other participants are and they will not be informed about your identity.</p>
    <p>
        There will be <strong>{{ Constants.num_rounds|apnumber }} rounds</strong> of {{ Constants.time_in_minutes|apnumber }} minutes. You and the other group members will be performing the same task as in the trial.</p>
    <p>
        In the <strong>first round all participants</strong> will have the same payoffs.<br>
    <p>
        In all the <strong>following rounds</strong>, exactly <strong>one out of the {{ Constants.players_per_group|apnumber }} group members</strong> will get
        <strong><em>{{ Constants.tokensper_string_high|apnumber }} tokens</em></strong> per correct sequence.
   </p>
    <p>
        To win the double payoff you will have the opportunity to invest some of your earnings from the <i>Letter Counting Task</i>.
        Your probability of obtaining the higher reward is equal to your share of total production. You can keep what you do not invest,
        but your investment will not be refunded if you do not win the prize nor can you use your earnings from previous rounds.
        The more you invest, the higher are your chances!
    </p>
    <p>
        On the next screen, you will see an illustrative example of how the prize is awarded.</p>
